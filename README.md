# Hollywood Movies

## Aim
The goal of this project is to analyze the performance of Hollywood movies, focusing on a dataset of films released between 2007 and 2012. We intend to explore various attributes that may influence a movie's success, such as title, genre, production studio, profitability, and ratings.

## Data
The dataset includes the following fields for each movie:

- Title: The name of the movie.
- Genre: The category or type of film.
- Studio: The production house behind the film.
- Profitability: Financial success measured against production and marketing costs.
- Ratings: Critical and audience assessments of the movie.
- 
The data has been sourced from InformationIsBeautiful.net, which is a reputable platform for data visualization and information graphics.
